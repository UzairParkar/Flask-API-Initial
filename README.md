### Flask-API-Initial 
Note: This Repository includes all the different types of restful APIs that i have created using Python as my language and **Flask** as my Framework and **Postman** as a place where i test my APIs. 

*Note: For more information check the requirements.txt file of each project. 

1. __Basic Flask API__: This is a simple Flask API with routes that define a home and placeholder function that checks the age. 


2 __CRUD With DS__: This is another simple API which is created by using a __Python Data Structure__ as a database. I have visualised the API as created for a notes app for better documentation and understanding. I have also given it different routes which allow me to perfrom CRUD operations using various HTTP methods.
3. __To-Do-Application__: This is a to do application created using the tutorial provided by CodeWithHarry. Creating this allowed me to learn as to how a data is sent from the frontend to the database, it was created using SQL ALCHHEMY and Flask. it gave me a overview of the basic understanding of **Libraries**,**Jinja2**,**Template Inheritence** and **SQL ALCHEMY**

4. __Flask-Rest-API-SQL-ALCHEMY__: An API created using Flask SQL ALCHEMY, now seeing as json is not serialisable i have created a function to convert the data to dictionary format.

5. __Flask-Marshmallow__: An API using the Marshmallow Extension. which allows me to serialise the data directly 

6. __Flask-Excel-Reader__: This API allows me to process and send data from an excel and CSV file to the database. 

7. __Flask-Excel-CSV-Crud__: This API allows us to perform crud operations using the excel oe csv files. changes made in the excel files and csv files are detected when the api is hit and the data is changed  

8. __Flask-Auth-Without-ORM__: This Api serves as a foundation in creating login and login out systems, work on this file was done using MySQL database modules and session from flask.
